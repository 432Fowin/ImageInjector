## üêõ Known Issues

### Current Limitations
- **Memory Usage**: Large images (>10MB) may cause memory issues
- **JAR Signatures**: Original signatures are removed during processing
- **Single Threading**: GUI operations are single-threaded
- **File Size**: Very large JARs (>100MB) may process slowly

### Workarounds
- Use image resizing for large files
- Re-sign JARs after processing if needed
- Process large JARs in smaller batches
- Close other applications for memory-intensive operations

### From Development to v1.0.0
This is the initial release, no migration needed.

### Future Migration Notes
- Configuration file format changes will be documented here
- API breaking changes will include migration examples
- Deprecated features will have removal timelines
